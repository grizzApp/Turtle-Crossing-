# 🐢 Turtle Crossing Game

A mini-game built with Python's `turtle` graphics module.  
Inspired by the classic Frogger-style gameplay, your mission is to help the turtle cross a busy road filled with speeding cars. Each successful crossing increases the level and difficulty.

---

## 🎮 Gameplay Features

- Simple and intuitive controls using the keyboard
- Randomly generated cars with varying speeds and positions
- Level system: each crossing increases difficulty
- "Game Over" display when turtle gets hit
- Modular code with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
